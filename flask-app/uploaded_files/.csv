92,Digitalising a colorimetric biosensor,"Current wearable sensors are mostly on biophysical markers with very few on biochemical markers. Biochemical markers provide important information on human body health conditions. All current biochemical sensors are invasive, painful and inconvenient to operate. IMRE has developed a proof-of-concept (POC) technology for detecting sweat-based biochemicals such as glucose, lactate, uric acid, and creatinine that is non-invasive, painless and convenient by using the colorimetric approach. Through photoconductivity, biomarker concentration can be quantified in the form of a direct readout. Data is directly displayed on the printed wearable without the need for interfacing with an external device or with a complex built-in spectrometer. This allows a user to have immediate access to his physiological status.","1) Spectroscopic characterisations for various types of polymers,

93,Dissecting the integrated stress response in lymphoma,"Lymphomas undergo considerable stress due to their enhanced metabolic programs that fuel growth and proliferation. Consequently, the integrated stress response (ISR) is often triggered to prevent the cells from being overwhelmed and dying.

Legged Robot Navigation through Advanced Depth Perception,"This project addresses a critical limitation in legged robot navigation: the ability to effectively traverse complex and unpredictable terrain. We propose a novel approach utilizing fine-tuned foundation models for perception and fusing separate data sources to improve the accuracy.

This project aims to enhance quadruped robot perception and locomotion by developing a system that improves depth estimation using RGB and sparse depth images. The system will refine initial depth predictions by focusing on relevant non-local neighbors, avoiding common issues like mixed-depth problems at boundaries. Through this processing, the robot will construct a detailed topographical map of its surroundings. This enhanced perception will enable the robot to adapt its navigation strategy in real-time, particularly in challenging terrains like:

Soft Terrain: Navigating deformable surfaces like sand or mud, traditionally problematic for wheeled robots.
Non-Rigid Terrain: Maneuvering through uneven landscapes with debris or obstacles.

This project contributes significantly to the advancement of perceptive locomotion in legged robots.","Students will gain experience with cutting-edge 3D vision systems and machine learning algorithms, enhancing their skills in computer vision and spatial data analysis. The project aims to contribute to the development of more robust and adaptable performance for legged robots traversing various terrains.

107,Enhancing source-free domain adaptive semantic segmentation with Transformers and multi-level consistency training,"We focus on source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which is highly challenging under the following two practical restrictions: 1) the source data are restricted from sharing due to proprietary, privacy, or profit related concerns; and 2) the target data are unlabeled due to the significant effort and cost involved in data labeling. Efforts on source-free UDA can be divided into vendor-side domain generalization and client-side domain adaptation. The vendor and the client have access to the labeled source and the unlabeled target datasets, respectively. The goal of the vendor is to train a source model with good generalization ability to unseen domains. This trained source model is next passed to the client to be adapted to the unlabeled target domain via self-training.","Students are expected to:

Drug Interactions within Amphiphilic Hydrogels,"Thermogels are amphiphilic polymers with the ability to form temperature-dependent supramolecular interactions that could lead to gelation. The advantage of a system whereby gelation happens with increasing temperature includes injectability and the potential to encapsulate heat-sensitive drugs and cells. By modulating the degree of hydrophobicity, we can tailor the degree of encapsulation and interactions with hydrophobic drugs. Students will be involved in materials synthesis, characterization of drug-hydrogel interactions through material characterization, and in vitro drug release.","Students will learn polymer synthesis and functionalization, spectroscopic characterization (e.g. NMR, FTIR), rheology, polymer self-assembly, physiochemical interactions between drugs and thermogels, and drug release mechanisms.","Synthesize and characterize chemical and mechanical properties of injectable hydrogels.
Assist with in vitro drug release experiments.

To develop the students' knowledge, he/she student is expected to read widely, comprehend, and summarize the relevant literature.","B.Sc in Chemistry,

124,Few-Shot Prompt Learning with Foundation AI Models for Semiconductor Visual Inspections,"The emergence of foundation AI models, e.g. GPT and SAM, is going to reshape the landscape of AI research. These foundation models are created by training deep networks with unprecedented scales on datasets of orders of magnitudes larger than the ones we have ever seen before. The capability of zero-shot inference and robustness to out-of-distribution has been dramatically increased by foundation AI models. Nevertheless, many downstream tasks, e.g. semicondcutor images, are not fully covered by the training dataset of foundation model, thus still posing challenges. For example, segmenting out defect regions for semiconductor image inspection is still not full addressed by segment-anything (SAM) model due to the ambiguity of semantics, i.e. what is defined as defect.

200,Multi-Sensor Mobile Edge Platform for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Co-Optimization,"Combining multiple sensors has been shown to improve both robustness and accuracy of localization systems, which is important in applications such as Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), and Autonomous Vehicle (AV). Due to the high computational complexity, it is necessary to offload some of the processing to the cloud, such that sensor fusion can be performed at the edge, while the heavy-lifting computation can be done at the cloud. In 3D Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), the sensors are used to construct map information of the surrounding environment, which can be used to guide the beamforming design for communications. As such, there is interesting trade-off between the sensor fusion strategy, amount of data that is offloaded to the cloud, the quality of the reconstructed map, and how accurate the beamforming design can be tuned to improve the communications link.

While increased outdoor light exposure can mitigate myopia progression, the impact of specific light exposure patterns remains unclear, especially for severe myopia (SE < -0.5 D).

Our study employs explainable AI techniques like SHAP and LIME to analyze light intensity data from FitSight trackers worn by 483 children in the GUSTO cohort. We leverage deep learning models to handle the complex time series data, aiming to understand how different light exposure patterns affect myopia development.

By segmenting data into various times of day and school vs. non-school hours, we will identify the most effective light exposure patterns to reduce myopia risk.

However, unlike other highly prevalent diseases, it remains underrepresented with limited effective therapeutic. Therefore, there is an urgent need to prioritize novel and effective therapeutic development. To address this, we established an innovative therapeutic target identification and validation platform for NAFLD therapeutic development.

217,Optimizing CO2 Electroreduction: Predicting Adsorption Energies on High-Entropy Alloys with Machine Learning,"Cu is the only single-metal catalyst capable of producing hydrocarbons and oxygenates (e.g., alcohols) during CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), making it a good candidate. However, its activity and selectivity for desired products are insufficient for industrial applications. Efforts have been made to enhance the base Cu catalyst. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), typically a mix of five different metals, have shown excellent mechanical properties and potential as catalysts for electrochemical reactions. According to Sabatier's principle, an optimal catalyst binds an adsorbate with appropriate binding energy: too strong, and they block active sites; too weak, and they are not sufficiently present on the surface to allow reaction. The adsorption energy of key intermediates is a good indicator of catalyst effectiveness. However, the vast configurational space in HEA catalysts makes modeling adsorption sites challenging.

In this project, the student will develop machine learning models trained with high-quality quantum chemical calculations to predict the adsorption energy of key intermediates during CO2RR. The model will use local environment features (e.g., type of bonding metal atom, number of neighbors) and be tested with cross-validation techniques before deployment.

223,"Physiological triggers of hair follicle development, degeneration and preservation of stem cell longevity","Hair follicles are mini-organs that undergo cycles of regeneration, regression and rest during homeostasis, but how hair follicles are properly developed, and how active ones transit into a state of regression remain poorly understood. Utilizing in vivo mouse models, the student will be involved in characterizing mutant mice with defective hair follicle development by processing skin tissues for barrier assays, cryosectioning, histology and immunofluorescence. The student will also be involved in optimizing methods to harvest regressive hair follicles for downstream single cell omics experiments that will elucidate how cells are spared from death and selected as stem cells for future hair regeneration. We envision these findings to help unlock new treatment portals for hair loss.","1. Deep understanding of hair biology

224,Precise magnetometry for tracking the motion of superconduting levitated ferromagnetic particle,"A ferromagnetic particle is predicted to precess about the magnetic field like the atoms at a Larmor frequency under conditions where its intrinsic spin dominates over its rotational angular momentum. Observing the atomic precession at a mesoscopic scale requires frictionless levitation to allow free precession and good magnetic shielding to reduce the orbital angular momentum. Such levitated freely precessing ferromagnetic particle is a correlated system of spins, which can rapidly average quantum uncertainty. The dynamic of such a particle can be well described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. The crystal lattice of the precessing ferromagnetic particle can relax fast and follow the collective spin within nanoseconds due to the fast Gilbert damping. The “artificial atom” can be used for developing next-gen quantum sensors whose sensitivity can be far beyond the standard quantum limit : gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravimeters, and accelerators","the student will have a better understanding of precise magetometry,
and the fundamental applications, such as dark matter detection
and fifth force detection","help to construct and develop precise magnetometry,

Object Grasping Using Tactile Feedback,"Robotic grasping presents a significant challenge in robotics.  For example, in the cases where objects appear visually similar but have different intrinsic properties [such as weight, center of mass (CoM), mass/density distribution, surface properties, etc.], successful and stable robotic object grasping can be challenging by using visual information only. To address this challenge, physical interaction with objects is essential and the sense of touch can be used. Such interaction allows the exploration of the object’s intrinsic properties. To obtain the interaction information, tactile sensors, providing the rich contact information from physical interaction with their contacting environments/objects that cannot be simply told from vision, are integrated into the robot gripper. 
In this project, the objective is to to design and implement a manipulation planning and control framework that utilizes tactile feedback information to achieve stable and robust object grasping with a robotic gripper. The framework will be specifically applied to the task of grasping objects with different intrinsic properties. The work of this project mainly includes object grasping data collection and algorithm development for tactile-guided manipulation planning.",Ability to impletment sensor-based control in a robotic system.

240,Robust Language-Conditioned Imitation Learning for Robotic Manipulations,"Although reinforcement learning has achieved huge success in the field of language-conditioned robot manipulation, these approaches often confront limitations due to low sample efficiency and the requirement for careful reward development to learn, which poses challenges in obtaining sufficient training data for effective learning. As a result, other researchers have turned to language-conditioned imitation learning approaches, which train agents using demonstration datasets to overcome the limitations associated with reinforcement learning. There are two main approaches in the field of imitation learning, namely, behavior cloning and inverse reinforcement learning. Many language-conditioned imitation learning algorithms are developed from goal-conditioned imitation learning by alternative the goal to the language instruction. The goal-conditioned policy enables the agent to handle multiple language instructions. Many of these approaches assume the language commands are perfectly accurate. However, this assumption may not always be true. The imperfect language commands will result in incorrect robotic manipulations. The goal of this project is to propose a robust language-conditioned imitation learning method against imperfect language commands.

274,Translational PK-PD approaches in oncology ,"At present, there exist no systematic methods for translating results between in vitro and in vivo systems. Recent PK-PD modeling efforts suggest exposure-response relationships are a way of translating results across systems. The student will evaluate various modeling approaches and systems to find out which methods work best for subsequent in vivo predictions. ","Through this project, the student will learn how to do database curation and management in R, and how to build structural pharmacokinetic models in either NONMEM or monolix.

276,Ultrasensitive photodetectors for nanophotonics devices,"This project focuses on developing single-photon avalanche detectors integrated with an on-chip photonics circuit. We work on two types of detectors -- 1) avalanche photodetectors that detect photons by rapidly multiplying photogenerated charge carriers via an avalanche effect, and 2) superconducting detectors that detect light when the absorbed photons disrupts its superconducting state. The student will largely be involved in device fabrication, setup building, and thorough characterization of the devices, using the results to improve subsequent devices. These waveguide-based single-photon detectors will be a critical part of our ongoing research efforts to develop an integrated quantum nanophotonics platform.","- In-depth knowledge of photonics devices and single-photon detection

278,Ultrasonic Beam-forming,"The focus of this project will be on the design, prototyping, and programming of the electronics circuits which are needed to control and receive signals to and from the ultrasonic array micro-chip. We will use AMD Vivado to program the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) in the Kria K26 System-on-Module (SoM) to generate signals with time-delay amongst the 80 channels. 80 electrical channels are required for independently controlling the 80 transducers in the ultrasonic array chip. The voltages from the digital channels will be amplified to 20 volts peak-to-peak using the MAX14808 pulser chips. To receive the signals for real-time image processing of the 3D map, we will need bandpass filters, operational amplifiers, and analog-to-digital converters between the ultrasonic array and the Kria K26 System-on-Module (SoM). The SoM will feed the data into a computer for further processing. We will conduct progressive testing of the electronics by first testing one channel using components mounted on a breadboard, before proceeding to increase the number of concurrent channels up to 80 channels.

279,Understanding the role of Malassezia on skin and wounds,"Malassezia yeast are human skin pathobionts. They are associated with multiple skin diseases such as pityriasis versicolor, dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Preliminary in vitro co-cultures of Malassezia furfur and human keratinocytes reveal a competitive interaction, where both species incur detrimental effects as part of the interaction. We hypothesize that this competitive interaction between the skin and Malassezia contributes to disease pathogenesis.  In this project, we first aim to determine if the interactions are species-specific by utilizing other common skin Malassezia species, M. globsa and M. restricta. Then, we aim to characterize the molecular mechanisms of interaction through transcriptomics, identifying genes and pathways that are similarly or differently activated between the Malassezia species. ","The intern will gain first-hand wet lab experience working in a BSL-2 biology lab. They will include methods such as media preparation, microbiological culture, keratinocyte culture, and analytical biochemistry.  The intern will also be able to apply their theoretical knowledge in biomedical science by gaining hands-on experience and learning important skills such as maintaining a lab notebook, interpreting experimental results, and preparing research and literature review presentations.
