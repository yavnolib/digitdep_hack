11,Adaptive Grasping Strategies for High-Mix Low-Volume (HMLV) Handling Project,"Project Overview: Over time, the manufacturing sector has transformed its operations to create personalized products that cater to individual customer needs. This has led to a significant variability in product manufacturing and packaging, particularly in small quantities. The manufacturing of various products in small batches, known as High-Mix Low-Volume (HMLV) manufacturing and packaging, currently heavily relies on manual processes within many manufacturing plants. However, the efficiency of these processes is impeded by the design of grippers. Grippers play a critical role in picking up and placing a diverse range of products into packaging boxes during daily operations. Background: While the use of robotic grippers can greatly enhance the efficiency of pick-and-place tasks, the current methods for designing these grippers are manual and experience-driven. These processes are time-consuming and lack the adaptability needed to accommodate changes in manufacturing requirements. There is a clear need for an innovative design approach that enables rapid iterations in the creation of task-specific robot grippers. This addresses the demand for greater flexibility and quicker adaptation to changes in manufacturing needs. Furthermore, incoming parts often have varying orientations, often requiring adjustments before placement. Achieving this level of versatility in robotic grippers remains a significant challenge. This has typically been approached by incorporating additional controllable degrees of freedom or specialized grasping hardware, resulting in highly complex control mechanisms. Striving for a level of versatility akin to human capabilities with a single gripper and a reduced number of actuators is a complex task. Finding an optimal method to achieve this remains an open area of research in both robot manipulation and gripper development.","Students will work with experienced scientists and engineers in SIMTech, and gain hands-on experience in mechanical design, device fabrication and advanced characterization systems in SIMTech.","1. Explore evolutionary design approaches to create adaptive grippers. This involves iterative processes of selection, mutation, and recombination inspired by biological evolution. The goal is to progressively enhance gripper designs over successive generations.
2. Develop a strategy for multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-DOF) actuation using soft and hybrid actuators. These actuators may incorporate both soft and rigid materials, allowing for axial, twist, and omni-directional bending movements.
3. Develop strategies for gripper reconfiguration, enabling fast adaptation to different configurations. This includes the implementation of interchangeable modules and a universal mechanical interface.","General knowledge in mechanical engineering.

46,Collaborative Logistics Planning,"collaboration and coordination among logistics service providers to provide quality fulfilment services while ensuring cost and carbon efficiency and challenging operational constraints in inventory, routing, packing, and loading/unloading.  The underlying logistics planning algorithms in existing solutions always consider the logistics planning as an optimisation problem and describe it in the form of mathematical programming, which is hard to capture the dynamics and collaboration among players. Furthermore, existing logistics planning solutions always ignore some realistic yet crucial factors such as loading sequence and inventory status.  They affect not only the collaboration among the players, but also the eventual logistics cost. Due to the computational hardness, a multi-party logistic planning solution taking into account all above factors is desired yet out of reach so far.  In this project, we will explore to tackle the dynamics (e.g. the demands, inventory, and fulfilment status), and the coordination among logistics players and other players, a learning-to-optimise planning algorithm will be developed.

47,Colorimetric wearable sensor for analyte detection ,"Printed wearables are gaining traction due to its potential as tools for personalized healthcare assistants. The advent of wearables such as Fitbit and Samsung Gear Fit are synonymous with fitness enthusiasts. However such devices monitor physical vital signs such as heart rate and blood pressure. Information at the physiological level is undoubtedly more practical as it provides pertinent feedback of a user’s health. As such, sweat sensors can fulfil this gap. As a non-invasive approach, sweat is attractive as it is easily accessible. With a trove of biomarkers in this hypotonic fluid, useful onsite diagnostic information can be gleaned. Usually, a wireless communication component has to be integrated, allowing a user to synchronise with an interface for data interpretation. For ease of operation, this is typically accomplished by a smartphone. However, this can be distractingly cumbersome for a fitness enthusiast. In this project, we aim to eliminate the use of wireless communication by offering a solution in the form of a direct readout. Data is directly displayed on the printed wearable and this allows a user to have immediate access to his physiological status. By using a colorimetric approach, photoconductors will complement with a chemical-responsive active layer.

67,Design of an optical metalens for photoacoustic imaging applications,"Photoacoustic imaging is a medical imaging technique that combines the strengths of two different modalities :  optical imaging and ultrasound imaging. It involves the use of nanosecond pulses of laser light to excite the molecules in tissues, which leads to the absorption of the laser energy and the generation of heat. This heat is then converted into sound waves, which can be detected by an ultrasound detector and used to create an image of the tissue. In biomedical applications, photoacoustic imaging has been used for a wide range of purposes, including the detection and diagnosis of cancer, the evaluation of blood flow and oxygenation, and the monitoring of therapeutic treatments. A compact photoacoustic imaging device with high spatial resolution can be more easily transported and used in a variety of different settings, including hospitals, clinics, research laboratories, and even in the field. This makes it possible to perform photoacoustic imaging in a wider range of situations, allowing for more flexibility and convenience in the use of the technique. However, traditional lenses could distort the acoustic wavefront, requiring complex systems to correct it; hence, the overall device are rigid and bulky.

It is our goal to develop a photoacoustic metalens that focuses light, with similar performance characteristics as current solutions, but that simultaneously allows minimal acoustic distortion for an ultracompact design and assembly. Specifically, we aim to demonstrate a photoacoustic flat lens with 90% focusing efficiency, a numerical aperture NA>0.2, and a transmission T>90% for the acoustic wave.","Experience to work in an international team on a multi-partite project,

167,Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models,"Most of you should heard about the ChatGPT, which is the most popular AI-associate toolkit. Its astonishing capability is powered by the large pretrained language models.  This project aims to pioneer the field of knowledge editing in large language models, a crucial but relatively nascent area in the development of artificial intelligence. The project's significance lies in its potential to enhance large models' capabilities in aspects such as incremental learning, learning to forget, and intellectual property (IP) protection, which are vital for the evolving landscape of AI technologies.
Knowledge editing in large language models involves modifying or updating the model's stored information without comprehensive retraining. This ability is increasingly important for large models, as it can provide flexibility in learning new information (incremental learning), removing outdated or unwanted data (learning to forget), and protecting sensitive or proprietary information (IP protection). Current research on this topic is in the preliminary stages, with some pilot work attempting to locate and edit specific knowledge within large models. However, these methods are not entirely satisfactory. They often come with significant additional costs, such as negatively impacting the storage and expression of other knowledge within the model. There's a notable challenge in pinpointing and manipulating specific pieces of information within the neural networks of increasingly large pre-trained models.
This research will delve into developing more effective and efficient methods for knowledge editing in large language models. The project will explore novel approaches to identify, update, and manage the information within these models, aiming to minimize the adverse side effects on the model's overall knowledge base. It will also investigate the theoretical underpinnings of knowledge representation in neural networks, particularly in the context of large-scale pre-trained models.","1.

170,Learning robust graph neural networks,"Graph neural networks have achieved tremendous breakthroughs in various learning problems arising from diverse real-world applications. What makes graph neural networks effective is they generate representations to the downstream predictive tasks in a globally relational manner. In other words, representations are inferred via particular operations between themselves and their observed neighbors. However, prevalent functions for generating representations adopted by graph neural networks solely consider the effect brought by the information propagated within the neural architecture but overlook the knowledge hidden in the task-specific context. This may cause overfitting when training graph neural networks and consequently may reduce the generalization capability of the graph neural architecture. To overcome the previously mentioned problems, this project aims to develop novel and robust graph neural networks in two complementary directions. One is to design novel generating functions concerning the instant knowledge acquired from the task-specific context so as to locally consummate neural message passing. The other is to propose novel learning objectives that may seemly incorporate the learning modules for capturing the context-specific knowledge, achieving the improvement on the global neural architecture. The paradigms of learning graph neural networks and solving real-world applications are thereby expected to be fundamentally innovated.","Developing novel, generic graph learning models for various downstream tasks; paper/report writing.","Data preprocessing, design and development of computational models, and paper writing.","Familiar with Python, Pytorch, basic knowledge about graph theory, linear algebra, and statistics",IHPC,He Tiantian,"Institute of High Performance Computing, 1 Fusionopolis Way, Connexis North, #16-16, Singapore 138632","Computing and Information Sciences,Computer Science",1

These models are derived from the underlying physics and mechanics of the system. Learning-based control, in contrast, leverages empirical data and advanced algorithms, particularly machine learning techniques, to develop control strategies. It is especially useful in situations where obtaining an accurate mathematical model is challenging or impractical. However, the black-box nature, complex structure, and the requirement for a large amount of training data pose various challenges.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to prioritize novel and effective therapeutic development. To address this, we established an innovative therapeutic target identification and validation platform for NAFLD therapeutic development. We strategically combined in-depth transcriptomic profiling of NAFLD patient samples with in vivo RNAi screens in NAFLD mouse models to identify potential therapeutic targets, which is ultimately for fast translation to siRNA-based therapeutic development from the screening result. A list of target candidates was identified through our in vivo screening approach, and the promissing targets are now being validated utilizing our proprietary target validation platforms.","Our target identification and validation process for NAFLD therapeutics development is divided into three main steps: target selection through bioinformatics analysis of screening data, followed by in vitro validation, and finally, in vivo validation. Consequently, our lab conducts a wide range of experiments using bioinformatics tools, molecular biology techniques, human in vitro disease modeling, and in vivo mouse studies.

They are sometimes denoted as “Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)” devices (Preskill, 2018), meaning their qubits are not error corrected and, therefore, imperfect. Most of the current NISQ algorithms rely on harnessing the power of quantum computers in a hybrid quantum-classical arrangement.

217,Optimizing CO2 Electroreduction: Predicting Adsorption Energies on High-Entropy Alloys with Machine Learning,"Cu is the only single-metal catalyst capable of producing hydrocarbons and oxygenates (e.g., alcohols) during CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR), making it a good candidate. However, its activity and selectivity for desired products are insufficient for industrial applications. Efforts have been made to enhance the base Cu catalyst. High-entropy alloys (HEAs), typically a mix of five different metals, have shown excellent mechanical properties and potential as catalysts for electrochemical reactions. According to Sabatier's principle, an optimal catalyst binds an adsorbate with appropriate binding energy: too strong, and they block active sites; too weak, and they are not sufficiently present on the surface to allow reaction. The adsorption energy of key intermediates is a good indicator of catalyst effectiveness. However, the vast configurational space in HEA catalysts makes modeling adsorption sites challenging.

In this project, the student will develop machine learning models trained with high-quality quantum chemical calculations to predict the adsorption energy of key intermediates during CO2RR. The model will use local environment features (e.g., type of bonding metal atom, number of neighbors) and be tested with cross-validation techniques before deployment.

236,Resource-Efficient Test-Time Adaptation of Foundation Models for Visual Analysis of Semiconductor Imagery,"The semiconductor industry is a significant contributor to Singapore's economy, accounting for about 7% of its GDP. This sector is a crucial part of the nation's manufacturing landscape, making Singapore a vital hub in the global semiconductor supply chain. Quality control is critically important in semiconductor manufacturing which may affect the yield rate and market competitiveness. Current approach towards quality control is often through analyzing the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images acquired by microscopes. For example, measuring the gaps between pins could indicate the defects. Identifying irregularities from the SEM with the guidance of design layout could automatically detect defects. The existing approaches towards these visual analysis tasks often adopt ad-hoc designed deep learning models and train the model with human labeled data. However, labeled data could be very expensive to acquire when analyzing the image requires domain expertise. Thus, fine-tuning foundation models for downstream tasks with limited annotation budget becomes a viable solution. Common solutions involve inserting adapter networks, prompt tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. However, when fine-tuned models are deployed, the working environment may experience constant distribution shift, potentially caused by sensor drift, change of product, etc. Maintaining a frozen model at inference stage will struggle with the distribution shift at test time. This challenge calls for a solution that is able to adapt a pre-trained model to testing data without extensive human intervention. In this project, we aim to tackle this challenge from two perspectives. First, we shall develop a unsupervised adaptation strategy to adapt a pre-trained model to downstream tasks at inference. This could be achieved by self-training on the model’s own predictions. When on-site machines do not have the capability to carry out self-training based on backpropagation due to memory constraint, we aim to develop a computation efficient fine-tuning approach. This could be achieved by Hebbian learning theory. Finally, we could introduce limited human intervention at inference stage to further calibrate the adaptation. This prompts us to explore active learning on a testing data stream to maximize the utilization of limited annotation budget.","Develop backpropagation-free domain adaptation methods for semiconductor image analysis

239,Robotic Object Grasping Using Tactile Feedback,"Robotic grasping presents a significant challenge in robotics.  For example, in the cases where objects appear visually similar but have different intrinsic properties [such as weight, center of mass (CoM), mass/density distribution, surface properties, etc.], successful and stable robotic object grasping can be challenging by using visual information only. To address this challenge, physical interaction with objects is essential and the sense of touch can be used. Such interaction allows the exploration of the object’s intrinsic properties. To obtain the interaction information, tactile sensors, providing the rich contact information from physical interaction with their contacting environments/objects that cannot be simply told from vision, are integrated into the robot gripper. 
In this project, the objective is to to design and implement a manipulation planning and control framework that utilizes tactile feedback information to achieve stable and robust object grasping with a robotic gripper.

As a result, other researchers have turned to language-conditioned imitation learning approaches, which train agents using demonstration datasets to overcome the limitations associated with reinforcement learning. There are two main approaches in the field of imitation learning, namely, behavior cloning and inverse reinforcement learning. Many language-conditioned imitation learning algorithms are developed from goal-conditioned imitation learning by alternative the goal to the language instruction. The goal-conditioned policy enables the agent to handle multiple language instructions. Many of these approaches assume the language commands are perfectly accurate. However, this assumption may not always be true. The imperfect language commands will result in incorrect robotic manipulations. The goal of this project is to propose a robust language-conditioned imitation learning method against imperfect language commands.

In such case, a tactile sensor, providing the additional information from the physical interaction between the manipulator and the environment, can help the manipulator to pass through the dense environment and approach the target object. This is similar to the touch sensing feedback of humans. With the tactile information, the robot system must be able to process this information and carry out suitable actions of the manipulator so as to accomplish the desired task. .

284,Using AI for Convective Weather Forecast to Support Singapore Air Traffic Operations,"Singapore’s convective weather is complex and highly variable, which complicates prediction of frequency, severity, and location. This could significantly erode operational efficiency in air traffic management and thereby institutional reputation if mismanaged. Hence, we aim to leverage state-of-the-art technology to enhance the accuracy and spatio-temporal resolution of weather forecasting around Singapore customized to aviation needs, thereby providing better prediction of aviation-relevant convective weather. Specifically, we will focus on short-term (2-hour nowcast) weather prediction and improve existing AI-based models in the following aspects.

1) While most existing work focuses on learning from a single modality, we will investigate the importance and correlations among different input modalities, including but not limited to radar data, satellite imagery, wind profile, rainfall data, and lightning data. As different modalities may have different geographical coverage and resolutions, a separate neural network can be trained to generate synthetic data for missing modalities (e.g., radar) from other available modalities (e.g., satellite). 

2) We plan to develop advanced physical-informed AI-based weather nowcasting models by incorporating physical dynamics into the neural networks. Physics-based models predict the weather evolution based on physical principles, which provide complementary information to conventional AI solutions. Thus, their output can be used as conditions to guide the nowcasting and forecasting performance of deep learning-based models.  ","Towards the end of this internship, the student will
1) establish a solid background on deep learning based weather nowcasting models.
2) have the capability of implementing and analyzing deep learning based weather nowcasting models on customized dataset.
3) transform results to publications, e.g. as paper, poster or demo.","The student is expected to work closely with other A*STAR researchers in the team to jointly complete the following tasks while individually taking ownership of some sub-tasks:
1) Conduct exploratory analysis for insight discovery, over the rich datasets available for the research (weather satellite data, rainfall sensory readings, lightning data, etc), which include both image data and structured data.
2) Clean data and prepare data for AI model development pipeline.
3) Research on state-of-the-art models on convective weather detection and prediction.
4) Implement, test and analyze machine learning and deep learning models for the project.
5) Transform results to reports, publications, or demo.","Strong in programming, preferably to have rich experience in Python.
